1. Default Transaction Process Manager

A `DefaultTransactionProcessManager` and `DefaultTransactionProcessManagerTest` have been added to the repository. Make them work with your implemented solution by importing the right events in both classes (and check 0. setup.md for any other steps you'll need to do).

Your assignment is to get the `DefaultTransactionProcessManagerTest` working, and understand how process managers are implemented in this repository.
