2. High value Transaction Process Manager

For transactions > 100 tokens, we want to manually approve them before they will continue.

Create a new process manager that will listen to the TransferInitiated event and will only start when the tokens amount is over 100.
You can dispatch the command `RequestFraudDetection` from your process manager, in order to request a fraud detection check. 

The fraud detection context will call the ProcessManager with `TransactionApproved` or `TransactionRejected` events.
(UI for fraud detection will be added asap, so we can demo it outside of tests).
