0. Setup

To add the process manager capabilities there is some setup required that might lead to some merge conflicts with your current working branch. This guide will take you through all changes added. 

## 1. Add process ID's to events

Events can now implement the `HasProcessIds` interface. Make sure the `getCorrelationId()` method returns the transaction id (if present). It might be difficult to add causation ID as well. So you could ignore that for now and return null there.
```php
    public function getCorrelationId(): ?string
    {
        return $this->transactionId?->toString();
    }
```

Make sure you add them to:
* `TokensWithdrawn`
* `TokensDeposited`

To add the transactionId to these events, you need to add them as param in the wallet methods: 
```php
public function deposit(int $tokens, string $description, \DateTimeImmutable $transactedAt, ?TransactionId $transactionId = null): void
    {
        $this->recordThat(new TokensDeposited($tokens, $description, $transactedAt, $transactionId));
    }

    public function withdraw(int $tokens, string $description, \DateTimeImmutable $transactedAt, ?TransactionId $transactionId = null)
    {
        if($this->tokens < $tokens) {
            $this->recordThat(WithdrawalFailed::becauseOfInsufficientFunds($transactionId));
            throw SorryCantWithdraw::becauseOfInsufficientFunds();
        }
        $this->recordThat(new TokensWithdrawn($tokens, $description, $transactedAt, $transactionId));
    }
```

## 2. Add a transfer Initiated event to the wallet. 

```php
<?php

namespace Workshop\Domains\Wallet\Events;

use EventSauce\EventSourcing\Serialization\SerializablePayload;
use Workshop\Domains\ProcessManager\HasProcessIds;
use Workshop\Domains\Wallet\Transactions\TransactionId;
use Workshop\Domains\Wallet\WalletId;

class TransferInitiated implements SerializablePayload, hasProcessIds
{

    public function __construct(
        public readonly TransactionId $transactionId,
        public readonly WalletId $receivingWalletId,
        public readonly int $tokens,
        public readonly string $description,
        public readonly \DateTimeImmutable $startedAt
    ) {
    }

    public function toPayload(): array
    {
        return [
            'transaction_id' => $this->transactionId->toString(),
            'receiving_wallet_id' => $this->receivingWalletId->toString(),
            'tokens' => $this->tokens,
            'description' => $this->description,
            'started_at' => $this->startedAt->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
        ];
    }

    public static function fromPayload(array $payload): static
    {
        return new static(
            TransactionId::fromString($payload['transaction_id']),
            WalletId::fromString($payload['receiving_wallet_id']),
            $payload['tokens'],
            $payload['description'],
            \DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', $payload['started_at']),
        );
    }

    public function getCorrelationId(): ?string
    {
        return $this->transactionId->toString();
    }

    public function getCausationId(): ?string
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

and in wallet:
```php
    public function transfer(
        Transactions\TransactionId $transactionId,
        WalletId $receivingWalletId,
        int $tokens,
        string $description,
        \DateTimeImmutable $now
    ) {
        if($this->tokens < $tokens){
            return;
        }
        $this->recordThat(new TransferInitiated($transactionId, $receivingWalletId, $tokens, $description, $now));
    }
```

## 3. Make sure the `WalletCommandHandler` calls your wallet methods with the right arguments. 

## 4. WalletServiceProvider
Make sure the `ProcessIdsDecorator` is added as decorator. 
Register the commands for the command bus using these lines in the register section of the WalletServiceProvider
```php
 /** @var InMemoryLocator $locator */
$locator = $this->app->make(InMemoryLocator::class);
$locator->addHandler($this->app->make(WalletCommandHandler::class), WithdrawTokens::class);
$locator->addHandler($this->app->make(WalletCommandHandler::class), DepositTokens::class);
```

## 5. run composer dump-autoload
The process manager logic was added as a context. In a production application it should be abstracted as a package instead of a context ofcourse.
