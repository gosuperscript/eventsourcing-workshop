# Corrections

We got a call from a customer that deposited 100 tokens in his wallet, instead of 10. We need to correct this transaction.

Since this is a correction caused by our customer, we want traceability. We add 2 new events, one that withdraws 100 tokens. And one that deposits 10 tokens.
We can use the description field to explain the corrections. Everything is fine again! 

We now find out a developer made a mistake, and accidentally deposited 100 tokens instead of 10. We see that the customer hasn't seen this yet, and want to correct it without extra transactions. 

Let's record this in a configuration file. We add an array with the eventId and the corrected amount in here. 

```<?php
return [
    'corrections' => [
        'b8d0b0e0-5c1a-4b1e-8c7c-1c6b1b1b1b1b' => 10,
    ],
];
```

1. Can you create an upcaster that takes this configuration file, and applies the corrections to the events?
2. Can you think of other correction strategies for the above scenario? What are the pro's/con's of each strategy?
