# Public events

In this bonus assignemnt, we'll take a look at public events! 

Imagine another context wants to consume our events. They don't want to keep track of the wallet balance themselves, so they ask us to put the balance in the event.
However, we've learned that our event data should be as small as possible. We don't want to put the balance in the event, since it's a derived value.

This is where public events can come in handy. We can create a reactor that listens to our events, and publishes a public event with the balance in it.

For public events, we can use the following package: https://github.com/Robertbaelde/PersistingMessageBus/

Install it using: `composer require robertbaelde/persisting-message-bus`

## Define your topic, and public events.
Create a PublicEvents directory in your Wallet context. And add an event and a topic in there. 

```php
<?php

namespace Workshop\Domains\Wallet\PublicEvents\Balance;

use Robertbaelde\PersistingMessageBus\BaseTopic;

class Balance extends BaseTopic
{
    public const BalanceUpdated = BalanceUpdated::class;

    public function getMessages(): array
    {
        return [
            'BalanceUpdated' => self::BalanceUpdated
        ];
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'Balance';
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace Workshop\Domains\Wallet\PublicEvents\Balance;

use Robertbaelde\PersistingMessageBus\BaseTopic;

class Balance extends BaseTopic
{
    public const BalanceUpdated = BalanceUpdated::class;

    public function getMessages(): array
    {
        return [
            'BalanceUpdated' => self::BalanceUpdated
        ];
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'Balance';
    }
}

```

Now we need to do some plumbing to register a dispatcher.
(Note, we bind the topic to the default message dispatcher. In a production application you'd create a dedicated BalanceMessageDispatcher class for this.)
```php
        $this->app->bind('WalletPublicEvents', function (Application $application) {
            return new IlluminateMessageRepository(
                connection: $application->make(DatabaseManager::class)->connection(),
                tableName: 'wallet_public_events',
                tableSchema: new \Robertbaelde\PersistingMessageBus\DefaultTableSchema()
            );
        });

        $this->app->bind(MessageDispatcher::class, function (Application $application) {
            return new MessageDispatcher(
                messageBus: new MessageBus(
                    new Balance(),
                    new IlluminateMessageRepository(
                        connection: $application->make(DatabaseManager::class)->connection(),
                        tableName: 'wallet_public_events',
                        tableSchema: new \Robertbaelde\PersistingMessageBus\DefaultTableSchema()
                    )
                ),
                messageDecorator: new DefaultMessageDecorator(new SystemClock()),
            );
        });
```

We need a table to store the public events in as well. 
Add the following migration: 
```php
Schema::create('wallet_public_events', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('message_id');
    $table->string('topic');
    $table->string('message_type');
    $table->longText('payload');
    $table->longText('headers');
    $table->timestamp('published_at');
    $table->index(['topic', 'id'], 'topic');
});
```

Now you have everything in place to create a reactor that publishes balance public events. Its up to you to code this up!
