# Add the basic functionality

As good ol' chaps, we start with a unit test first. 

Within `domains\Wallet\tests` you'll already find a `WalletTestCase` this is a class we can extend, that gives us some helpers to write tests for the wallet aggregate roots.

Event sourced aggregate roots often can be tested in the format: 
* Given: an initial state
* When: something happens
* Then: we expect some events

1. Let's create a test to deposit tokens to a wallet. Create a class called `DepositTokensTest` and make it extend `WalletTestCase`.


```php
    class DepositTokensTest extends WalletTestCase
    {
        /** @test */
        public function it_can_deposit_tokens()
        {
            $this->given()
                ->when(fn(Wallet $wallet) => $wallet->deposit(100))
                ->then(new TokensDeposited(100));
        }
```

When you run the test, you'll see that it fails.
It first will complain about the missing event `TokensDeposited`.

So let's create this event:

```php 
<?php

namespace Workshop\Domains\Wallet\Events;

use EventSauce\EventSourcing\Serialization\SerializablePayload;

final class TokensDeposited implements SerializablePayload
{

    public function __construct(
        public readonly int $tokens
    ) {
    }

    public function toPayload(): array
    {
        return [
            'tokens' => $this->tokens,
        ];
    }

    public static function fromPayload(array $payload): static
    {
        return new self(
            $payload['tokens']
        );
    }
}
```

You'll notice the event implements the `SerializablePayload` interface. This so that it can be serialized and deserialized in order to be stored in a database.

Now that we've imported the event, we get an undefined method error. So lets add a method to wallet.
```php
    public function deposit(int $tokens)
    {
    }
```

This leads us to the next error, pointing to us to record an event. 
> expected event count doesn't match recorded event count
> Failed asserting that actual size 0 matches expected size 1.

```php
    public function deposit(int $tokens)
    {
        $this->recordThat(new TokensDeposited($tokens));
    }
```

Our testsuite now guides us to our next step. We need to implement the `apply` method for the event. 
> EventSauce comes with a few different traits. Some of them check if the apply method exists first.

```php
    private function applyTokensDeposited(TokensDeposited $event): void
    {
    }
```

Now that we've added our apply function, we'll see that are test passes. ðŸŽ‰

Notice that we don't mutate state in the apply function yet. We'll only add state to the aggregate when we need it to verify business rules. 

Now that there is a starting point, it's the first assignment to add a withdrawal method and guard against overdrawing.
Remember we also want to keep track when a user fails to withdraw tokens.

Once you're done, you can compare your result with the example solution in the branch: `week1-question1`
