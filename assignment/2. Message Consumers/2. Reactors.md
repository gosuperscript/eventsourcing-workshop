# 2. Reactors

With EventSauce reactors and projectors are basically the same. They are classes that consume messages in the same way. 
The only difference there is, is that you should be able to replay projectors, and you shouldn't want to replay reactors.

* 2.1 Can you send a notification when the balance of a wallet goes over 100?
For this you can use the NotificationService. It has an inMemoryInterface to use in your tests. Bonus points if you don't trigger the notification when balance is updated when its over 100. (eg 99 to 101 triggers a notification. But once the balance goes from 105 to 110 there shouldn't be a notification).
