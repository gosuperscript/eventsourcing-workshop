# 3. Replaying

Imagine you build a new projector, and want to replay all the events that happened in the past. Or you find a bug in your read model, that can be fixed by replaying events.  

Recently EventSauce released some basic functionality to replay events. As a bonus exercise, try to implement the replay functionality for the `TransactionsProjector`.
